# Texti
Make both REST and GraphQL API's in a minute without coding.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- NodeJS (JavaScript runtime)
- MongoDB (NoSQL database)

## Instructions

Please follow the below steps to use Texti to generate API's.

- Ensure that MongoDB service is running and active by running `service mongod status`. If the MongoDB Database Server is inactive run `sudo service mongod start`.

- Now write the details of your API in plain English. Include the name you want to give to your service followed by the fields you want. 

Example:

Make a product API with the follwing fields.  

name:string  
description:text  
price:integer  
quantity:integer

- Now just run `magic` in your terminal. `magic` is an alias to `generateApi.sh` script.

- Sit back and relax for a minute. You will see links to your REST and GraphQL API as output in your terminal.
